This is a conceptual outline of the SQL queries you would write. You would fill in the queries with logic that matches your conceptual schema.

-- This SQL script contains a series of queries designed to power a business intelligence dashboard.
-- Each query calculates a specific KPI and is optimized for readability and performance.

-- ============================================================================
-- 1. Total Revenue Over Time
-- ============================================================================
-- This query calculates the total revenue for each month.
-- The results can be used to create a line chart showing revenue trends.
-- Assumes a 'sales' table with 'sale_date' and 'amount'.

SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date) AS month_start,
    SUM(amount) AS total_revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY
    month_start
ORDER BY
    month_start;


-- ============================================================================
-- 2. Sales Performance by Product Category
-- ============================================================================
-- This query calculates total sales grouped by product category.
-- Useful for a bar chart to show top-performing product categories.
-- Assumes 'sales' table joined with a 'products' table.

SELECT
    p.category,
    SUM(s.amount) AS total_sales,
    COUNT(s.sale_id) AS total_units_sold
FROM sales AS s
JOIN products AS p
    ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY
    p.category
ORDER BY
    total_sales DESC;


-- ============================================================================
-- 3. Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
-- ============================================================================
-- This query calculates the MRR for a subscription-based service.
-- Assumes a 'subscriptions' table with 'start_date' and 'monthly_price'.
-- This is a simplified calculation; more complex logic might handle churn.

SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('month', start_date) AS subscription_month,
    SUM(monthly_price) AS mrr
FROM subscriptions
GROUP BY
    subscription_month
ORDER BY
    subscription_month;


-- ============================================================================
-- 4. Customer Demographics
-- ============================================================================
-- This query provides a breakdown of customers by gender and region.
-- Useful for understanding customer segmentation for marketing.
-- Assumes a 'customers' table with 'gender' and 'region' columns.

SELECT
    region,
    gender,
    COUNT(customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM customers
GROUP BY
    region, gender
ORDER BY
    region, gender;


-- Add more queries for other KPIs as needed.
