                    After seven years immersed in the vibrant outdoor industry, a Stetson University CIS graduate (Class of 2019) is charting a new course back to the world of data analytics. This post shares my journey, highlighting how a blend of technical skills (SQL, Python, R, Tableau, Power BI, Excel, Google Sheets) and real-world experience is fueling this exciting career transition.

                <h2>The Path Less Traveled</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Sam Pratico, and for the past seven years, my office has often been the great outdoors. From guiding expeditions to managing operations in the outdoor industry, I've had the privilege of working in an environment that values resilience, problem-solving, and a deep appreciation for nature. It's been an incredible chapter, but now, I'm eager to embark on a new adventure—one that brings me back to my roots in data analytics.
                </p>
                
                <h2>My Foundation in Data</h2>
                <p>
                    My academic journey at Stetson University culminated in a Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Systems (CIS), complemented by minors in Business Systems and Analytics. This foundation equipped me with a robust understanding of how technology drives business, paired with the analytical mindset to extract meaningful insights from data. I gained hands-on experience with the tools that power the data world: SQL for database mastery, Python and R for statistical heavy lifting, and Tableau, Power BI, Excel, and Google Sheets for transforming complex data into clear, compelling visualizations.
                </p>

                <h2>Bridging Two Worlds</h2>
                <p>
                    While my career path diverged into the outdoor industry after graduation in 2019, my analytical muscles never truly atrophied. Whether it was optimizing logistical operations for a guided trip, analyzing gear inventory for efficiency, or tracking customer engagement with outdoor products, the principles of data-driven decision-making were always present. My time in the outdoor industry has instilled in me adaptability, leadership, and a keen ability to translate complex information into actionable strategies—skills that are invaluable in any data-driven environment.
                </p>

                <h2>Ready for a New Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                    Now, as I transition back into the data analytics field, I bring not only a strong technical toolkit but also a unique perspective honed by diverse, practical experience. I'm excited to leverage my passion for uncovering insights and my comprehensive technical background to contribute to innovative projects. I'm actively seeking opportunities where I can apply my expertise to solve business challenges, drive growth, and make a tangible impact.
