# E-commerce Sales Forecasting

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a time-series forecasting model to predict future sales for an online retailer. The goal is to provide data-driven insights that can assist with inventory management, marketing strategy, and resource allocation. By accurately forecasting sales, the business can avoid stockouts and reduce excess inventory costs.

## The Problem

E-commerce businesses often face challenges in predicting future demand. Inaccurate forecasts can lead to:
- **Lost Sales**: Not having enough product to meet customer demand.
- **Increased Costs**: Holding too much inventory, leading to storage costs and potential waste.
- **Inefficient Marketing**: Running campaigns when demand is low or missing opportunities during peak seasons.

This project addresses these challenges by developing a reliable forecasting model.

## Methodology

The analysis follows a standard data science workflow:

1.  **Data Collection**: The project uses a simulated dataset of daily e-commerce sales.
2.  **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, converted data types, and aggregated sales to a daily level.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized sales trends over time, identified seasonality (weekly, monthly, yearly), and detected holidays' impact on sales.
4.  **Modeling**: A time-series forecasting model was developed using **Facebook's Prophet library**. Prophet is well-suited for business data as it automatically handles seasonality and holidays.
5.  **Model Evaluation**: The model was evaluated using a holdout period to compare forecasted sales against actual sales, measuring performance with metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
6.  **Insights & Visualization**: The final model provides forecasts visualized on a graph, along with key insights on seasonal trends and special events.

## Key Findings

- The model successfully captured both long-term sales trends and short-term seasonality.
- We identified strong weekly seasonality, with sales peaking on weekends.
- Holiday periods, such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday, were significant drivers of sales volume.
- The forecast provides a clear picture of expected demand for the next 12 months, enabling proactive business decisions.
