# SQL-Based Business Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project focuses on creating a robust set of SQL queries to power a business intelligence (BI) dashboard. The primary goal is to provide a comprehensive view of key business metrics (KPIs) for stakeholders, enabling them to monitor company performance and make informed decisions. The project emphasizes writing clean, efficient, and well-documented SQL queries for a reporting environment.

## The Business Problem

Many businesses struggle with scattered data, making it difficult to get a unified view of performance. Manual reporting is time-consuming and prone to errors. This project solves that problem by:

-   **Centralizing Data**: Using SQL to pull data from various tables into a single, unified view.
-   **Automating Reporting**: Providing a script of queries that can be run on a schedule to automatically update a BI dashboard.
-   **Defining KPIs**: Establishing clear metrics that are consistent and reliable for business analysis.

## Methodology

1.  **Database & Schema**: A simulated database schema was designed to represent a typical business environment, including tables for sales, customers, products, and subscriptions.
2.  **Data Extraction**: Wrote a series of SQL queries to extract raw data from the tables.
3.  **Data Transformation**: Performed data cleaning and transformation directly within SQL (e.g., handling `NULL` values, converting data types, and creating calculated fields).
4.  **KPI Generation**: Developed complex queries to calculate key business metrics, such as:
    -   Total Revenue
    -   Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
    -   Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
    -   Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
    -   Sales by Product Category
5.  **Query Optimization**: Ensured queries were performant by using appropriate joins, indexing, and aggregate functions to minimize execution time.
6.  **Documentation**: Each query is heavily commented to explain its purpose, logic, and the resulting output.

## Key Metrics & Queries

This project includes queries to generate the following KPIs:

-   **Total Revenue & MRR**: A query to calculate revenue over time and monthly recurring revenue for subscription services.
-   **Customer & Sales Analysis**: Queries to analyze customer demographics, acquisition channels, and sales performance by region.
-   **Product Performance**: A query to rank products by sales volume and profitability.
-   **User Engagement**: A query to track user activity, such as logins and feature usage.

## Technologies Used

-   **SQL**: The core language for all queries.
-   **PostgreSQL**: The relational database used for this project (queries are adaptable to other SQL databases).
-   **BI Tool (Conceptual)**: The final queries are designed to be integrated into a tool like Tableau, Power BI, or Looker to create interactive dashboards.
