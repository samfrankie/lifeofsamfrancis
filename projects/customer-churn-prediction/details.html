            <p>
                This project aims to build a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn (i.e., cancel their service) for a telecommunications company. By proactively identifying at-risk customers, the business can implement targeted retention strategies, such as special offers or personalized support, to improve customer lifetime value and reduce churn rates.

            <h3 style="color: #ffffff;">The Business Problem</h3>
            <p>
                Customer churn is a significant challenge for subscription-based businesses. It's often more expensive to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one. Predicting which customers are likely to leave allows a company to intervene before it's too late. The model will help answer key business questions like:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Which customers are most likely to churn in the near future?</li>
                <li>What factors are the strongest predictors
